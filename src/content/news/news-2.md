Equipment choices matter significantly when shooting in Scotland's often challenging weather conditions. From waterproof camera bags to understanding how to protect your gear in harsh Highland storms, the right preparation can make the difference between a successful shoot and a ruined camera.

My approach focuses on lightweight, weather-sealed equipment that can handle everything from misty mornings in the Trossachs to the brutal winds of the Western Isles. I'll share specific techniques for maintaining sharp images in low light conditions and how to make the most of Scotland's famous golden hour light that appears so briefly during winter months.

Post-processing is equally important, especially when working with the dramatic skies and moody atmospheres that make Scottish landscapes so compelling. I'll walk through my workflow for bringing out the best in these challenging lighting conditions while maintaining the natural beauty of the scene.
