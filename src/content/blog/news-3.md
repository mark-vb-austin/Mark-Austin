Scotland's light is unlike anywhere else in the world. From the fierce, dramatic illumination that breaks through storm clouds over the Highlands to the soft, ethereal glow that filters through morning mist, understanding and working with these conditions is essential for any photographer serious about capturing the true spirit of Scotland.

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore practical techniques for making the most of Scotland's challenging but rewarding lighting conditions. You'll learn how to read weather patterns, anticipate the best light, and position yourself to capture those fleeting moments when the landscape is transformed by dramatic illumination.

We'll cover everything from technical camera settings for low-light conditions to compositional techniques that enhance the mood and atmosphere of your images. Whether you're interested in landscape photography or simply want to improve your understanding of natural light, this workshop will give you the tools and confidence to create compelling images in any Scottish weather.
