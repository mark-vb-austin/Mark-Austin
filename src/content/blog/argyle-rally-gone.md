title: How I Almost Lost an Entire Shoot and 3 Days of Editing
description: "Last week, while tidying up and syncing some albums, I almost lost three days’ worth of work — 166 fully edited images — gone in a blink."

Thankfully, I’ve built in a few redundancy habits over the years, and this time, they saved me.

## How I Normally Back Up

After every shoot or event, the first thing I do is back up the images — without fail. 

1. First, they go onto my computer.  
2. From there, they’re copied to my NAS (Network Attached Storage), which runs **RAID 6**.  
3. It’s a 4-bay setup, meaning even if *two drives* fail, my images are still safe.

(And let’s be honest — it’s not *if* a hard drive fails, it’s *when.*)

Once the photos are safely on the NAS, I wipe the memory cards and delete the folder from my desktop. Then I “Synchronise Folder” in Lightroom, let it build standard previews, and start editing.

But this time… I didn’t do that.

## Impatience Got the Better of Me

I was in a rush. The NAS was being slow (RAID 6 trades speed for redundancy), and I didn’t want to wait. I wanted to dive straight into editing. 

So I skipped a step — just one, seemingly harmless step.

Instead of syncing the images to the NAS and editing from there, I edited directly from my desktop folder. Everything seemed fine. I finished the edits, shared a few images on social media, and moved on. Didn’t open Lightroom for a week because, well… I was busy building this very website.

## The Mistake

A week later, I’m doing some housekeeping. I sync a new event into Lightroom and notice some folders from the Argyle Rally shoot are greyed out. 

Thinking they were leftovers — and confident the originals were backed up — I delete them to keep the catalogue clean.

That’s when the panic hit.

The *photos* were backed up — yes. But all my *edits*? Gone. Weeks of fine-tuning, colour grading, and storytelling in each frame… vanished.

To make it worse, in my flustered state, I closed Lightroom and (in a move I can only describe as divine wisdom) chose **not** to back up the catalogue when prompted.

## The Recovery Mission

Once the panic subsided, I reminded myself: this is exactly why I take regular backups of my Lightroom catalogue.

Here’s the thing — while my photos live on the NAS, the **Lightroom Classic catalogue has to live on the local machine**. But I use a syncing tool that automatically backs up the catalogue folder every time it detects a change.

So now came the big question:

> Did I *actually* back up the catalogue the last time I used Lightroom?

And if so, *how* do I recover those edits? Could I merge an old backup into the current catalogue without ruining the edits I’d already made to my newer shoot?

## Turns Out… It’s Pretty Simple

This was the first time I’d ever had to import from another catalogue. I feared I’d end up in a mess of mismatched albums or duplicated photos.

But actually, it’s dead simple:

1. In Lightroom:  
   `File > Import from Another Catalogue`
2. Let it sync.
3. Choose which albums you want to import or overwrite.

Since the Argyle Rally album wasn’t in the current catalogue at all, I just imported it as-is.

Boom. All my edits were back. The rest of the catalogue — including the most recent shoot — remained untouched. I backed up the new catalogue, cleaned out the old zipped backups, and breathed a big sigh of relief.

## The Lesson (or Reminder)

Backups and redundancy *matter*. They’re the only reason I didn’t have to redo hours of editing.

Sure, off-site backups would be ideal — but for now, my **RAID 6 NAS setup** is what I have, and I’m grateful I put that in place.

So if you’re like me and get tempted to rush into edits before everything’s properly synced… don’t. Or at least double-check your workflow. Because even with good habits, a single missed step can lead to a lot of stress.

But when things go sideways — and they sometimes will — it’s your backup routine that’ll save the day.
