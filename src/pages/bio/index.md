I've always had an interest in photography, but things really clicked into place when my first child was born. That's when I picked up my camera with more purpose: to document the moments that matter most—the ones that slip past when you're not looking.

Over the past few years, I've honed my craft, learning how to chase the kind of light and emotion that make a photo feel like more than just an image. Whether it's the quiet joy in a child's laugh, the chaos of a family gathering, or the stillness of a morning landscape—I try to capture what's real, warm, and worth remembering.

Most of my work is family-focused, with a storytelling approach. I shoot portraits, events, and sometimes product or documentary-style projects. I've had the privilege of photographing for others on occasion, and I'm always open to more—especially if there's a story behind it. My editing is simple and clean, driven by emotion. If I'm not feeling it, I don't force it.

Outside the camera, I'm big on family, lifting weights, and doing things right the first time. I believe in honesty, quality, and showing up for the people you care about.

In the end, I just want to capture memories—moments that you can look back on and still feel something. If you see that in my work, then I'm doing something right.
